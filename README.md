# Music-Genre-Classification
#This project was developed to detect various genres of music from audio files. Audio files are preprocessed to get all the required details like song name, length, bitrate variance, file type etc. Most of the files are categorized such that it was easier for us to train the nueral network model easily. Please check the code for better understanding.
